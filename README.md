# Complete Planet Survey

**Nexus:** <https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/16493>

A Starfield mod that completes a planet's survey — across every biome — the
moment you scan any single flora or fauna. Toggleable from **Settings →
Gameplay**.

Built as an SFSE plugin (DLL) + a tiny ESM (Settings toggle) + a Papyrus glue
script. Targets Starfield 1.16.236.0 with SFSE 0.2.19.

---

## What it does

When you press E on any plant or creature (scanner up via F, or a single tap
to trigger a scan):

- Planet survey % → **100%**, the `<Planet> Survey Data` slate drops into
  your inventory — same engine event that fires after a vanilla full survey.
- **BIOME COMPLETE** label fires for every biome on the planet, not just
  the one you're standing in.
- Instant Scan per-species GMSTs are patched so natural scans also complete
  individual species in a single press (same effect as the separate
  [Instant Scan](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/759) mod — built in).
- Nearby in-world refs (flora/fauna you can see in the scanner) refresh
  from blue "unscanned" to the scanned-colour outline.

`cgf "CompletePlanetSurveyQuest.CompleteSurvey"` from the console does the
same thing regardless of the toggle state.

## Install

1. Install [SFSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7589) and
   [Address Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3256).
2. Drop `CompletePlanetSurvey.zip` into Vortex / Mod Organizer 2 via
   `Mods → Install From File`. The archive is a flat `Data/`-prefixed layout
   (no FOMOD installer), which matches what popular Starfield SFSE mods ship
   and avoids a known MO2 install issue.
3. Launch via `sfse_loader.exe`.
4. In game: `Settings → Gameplay → Complete Planet Survey → Auto-Complete
   Survey on Scan` → **On**.

## How it works

Three layers. Each does one thing:

```text
ESM (CompletePlanetSurvey.esm) ─── a Settings-menu toggle record only.
                                   CK-authored GPOG + GPOF.
                ▲
                │ Game.GetFormFromFile(0x80C, ...) → GameplayOption.GetValue()
                ▼
Papyrus (CompletePlanetSurveyQuest.psc) ─── reads the toggle, orchestrates the
                                            four survey categories, calls DLL
                                            natives for the heavy lifting.
                ▲
                │ DispatchStaticCall("CompleteSurvey") from the poller.
                ▼
DLL (CompletePlanetSurvey.dll) ─── SFSE plugin: hooks the scan call site,
                                   binds the Papyrus natives, enumerates
                                   species, flips per-ref scan state, patches
                                   the Instant Scan GMSTs, runs a per-frame
                                   poller that gates deferred work.
```

### The core trick: spawn-and-scan per species

DB-level marks alone don't fire **BIOME COMPLETE** — the engine's per-biome
tracker only advances when a real `SetScanned` call fires on a ref of each
species. To cover every biome without physically visiting them:

1. Enumerate every flora + fauna species the planet tracks (engine aggregator
   `ID_1016657`, broader than Papyrus's per-biome `GetBiomeFlora`).
2. `PlaceAtMe` a ref of each species on the player — kept **initially disabled
   so invisible, no visual flicker**.
3. Call `SetScanned(true)` on each. That drives `ID_83008 → ID_52160` for
   fauna (works cleanly) or `ID_83008 → ID_83038` for flora. The flora path
   no-ops on `PlaceAtMe`'d refs because they lack the
   `(ID_939118, ref_formID)` component that `ID_83038` checks for.
4. For the flora gap, call `UpdatePlanetProgressForSpecies` — invokes
   `ID_52157` (the per-planet progress updater) directly, bypassing
   `ID_83038`'s component check.
5. `Disable + Delete` the spawned refs. Scan flags persist, refs don't.

### Why the dispatch is deferred

The scan hook fires *inside* the engine's scan call chain (`ID_52157 →
ID_97853`). Running `PlaceAtMe` for 20+ species from that context races
with the live scanner UI's ref-list rendering and crashes. So the hook only
sets a pending flag; an SFSE per-frame task (running between frames, outside
any engine call stack) picks up the flag and dispatches the actual
`CompleteSurvey` from a clean context.

### Instant Scan GMST patch

On plugin init we set `iHandScannerAnimalCountBase` and
`iHandScannerPlantsCountBase` to `1` via `RE::GameSettingCollection`. Each
individual scan now completes a species in one press — equivalent to the
dedicated [Instant Scan](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/759) mod.

### The ESM

Two CK-authored records, wired into the existing Gameplay settings section:

| Type | EditorID              | FormID   | Purpose                                   |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| GPOG | `CPSGroup`            | `0x080B` | Section header in Settings → Gameplay     |
| GPOF | `CPSScanAutoComplete` | `0x080C` | The actual toggle (checkbox, default off) |

### The hook

`REL::GetTrampoline().write_call<5>` on the `CALL` from `ID_52157`
(planet-progress updater) to `ID_97853` (survey notify). The call site is
found at runtime by scanning the first `0x400` bytes of `ID_52157` for an
`E8 rel32` whose decoded target equals the address of `ID_97853`.

---

## Ghidra findings we actually use

All offsets and IDs target Starfield 1.16.236.0. Address Library decouples
these IDs from runtime offsets so the mod survives game patches (as long as
the IDs stay mapped).

### Knowledge database

Survey state lives in a `BSComponentDB2` component called
`BSGalaxy::PlayerKnowledge`, attached **per body** (not on
`BGSPlanet::PlanetData`, which is shared immutable data). Two discriminator
globals select the component family:

- `ID_938333` (uint16, `.bss`) — per-planet-progress + trait discriminator
- `ID_939118` (uint16, `.bss`) — per-reference scan-state discriminator.
  Attached by biome procedural generation; **absent on `PlaceAtMe`'d refs**,
  which is why `ID_83038` (flora writer) no-ops on them and we bypass to
  `ID_52157` directly.

The knowledge manager singleton is `ID_126578()`. From there:

- `manager + 0x8B0` → DB pointer
- `db + 0x268` → `BSTHashMap` keyed on the 64-bit composite
  `(disc << 48) | (lower_id << 16)`
- Lookup via `ID_126806(container, out[4], &key)`:
  `out[3] == 0xfe0` → miss; otherwise
  `entry = out[2] + *(uint16*)(out[2] + 0x12 + out[3] * 4)`.

### Per-planet component value layout

```text
+0x00  uint64   header (slot count, etc.)
+0x18  ptr      slot array → 0x10-byte entries
                  +0x00  uint32  form_id
                  +0x04  uint32  flags (bit 0 = "known")
+0x20  ptr      subobj — used by ID_124898 to flip the scan byte at +0x21
```

The aggregator `ID_1016657` populates a caller-provided buffer (`>= 0x250`
bytes; we allocate `0x400`) with four arrays of form IDs across all biomes:
two uint-arrays (inline IDs, e.g. traits) and two `TESForm*[]` arrays
(pointer indirection, form ID at `*ptr + 0x28`). Our `MarkResourcesForPlanet`
iterates all four and calls `IncrementScanFlag`; our `EnumeratePlanetSpecies`
filters to `FLOR` + `NPC_` types to produce the spawn-and-scan list.

### Engine functions we call

| ID         | Signature                                       | What it does                                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `126578`   | `void*()`                                       | Knowledge-manager singleton getter                                    |
| `126806`   | `void*(container, out[4], &key)`                | Generic `BSTHashMap` lookup                                           |
| `52155`    | `void(planetId, BGSKeyword*, bool)`             | `SetTraitKnown` — sets bit + dispatches trait-progress event          |
| `52157`    | `void(ref, count, byte=0xd, byte, byte)`        | Per-planet progress updater. Hook target; we also call it directly    |
| `83008`    | `void(ref, scanned, byte=0xd, byte=0)`          | `SetScanned` inner — dispatches to flora or actor writer              |
| `97853`    | `void(ctx)`                                     | Survey-completion notify. Hook callee; generates Survey Data slate    |
| `124898`   | `void(subobj*, species_id, delta, 0)`           | Per-species scan-flag increment on subobj at `value + 0x20`           |
| `1016657`  | `void(buffer, planet_id)`                       | Per-planet survey aggregator — enumerates all tracked forms           |
| `83007`    | `char(ref)`                                     | `IsBiomeRef` — returns 0/1/2 based on biome component presence        |
| `65318`    | `void(buffer)`                                  | Aggregator buffer cleanup                                             |

### Hook path: from E-key to our code

```text
Player presses E to scan (scanner UI up via F)
  └─ Engine scan dispatch
       └─ ID_83008 (SetScanned inner)
            ├─ flora path:  ID_83038 → (component exists) → ID_52157
            └─ fauna path:  ID_52160 → ID_52157
                 └─ ID_52157 (planet-progress updater)
                      └─ CALL ID_97853 (survey notify)  ◄─── HOOK HERE
                           └─ our thunk:
                                ├─ call original ID_97853 first
                                └─ DispatchStaticCall("CompleteSurveyIfEnabled")
                                     └─ Papyrus: read GPOF, gate on
                                                 planet < 100%, queue flag
                                                                │
                                                                ▼
                              (engine scan unwinds, frames advance)
                                                                │
                              SFSE per-frame task polls the flag,
                              dispatches CompleteSurvey from clean context,
                              spawns + scans + cleans up every species.
```

A single intercept point covers all scan paths because every path converges
at `ID_52157 → ID_97853`. Deferring via the poller avoids the active-scanner
race.
